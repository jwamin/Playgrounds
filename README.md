# Playgrounds

Playgrounds is an amazing app for trying out techniques and prototyping ideas. There's no IB, so all UI needs to be created, laid out and constrained in code.

Most of the following were created using Swift Playgrounds for iPad and might require some tweaking to run in Xcode Playgrounds.

## Graphics

* Metal - Hello Triangle - A very slow but fully working example of how to implement `Metal` within Playgrounds, complete with shader! - Will Probably need Swift Playgrounds on iPad to run as Metal requires a physical device and won't run in a simulator, but could be adapted to the Mac.

## Augmented Reality

* ARKit ImageTracking - Setup an `ARKit` session to look for `ARReferenceImages` within Playgrounds.

## User Interface

* Card Screen - A Tinder style animated card screen with spring animations.

## Animation

* CA Orrery - A solar system animation created with `Core Animation`

* Spring Animation vs. Ease-In-Out - Simple demo of two types of animation timing. Remember to use spring animations!

## Utilities 

* ColorPicker - An 'app within an app'. Create RGBA colors with sliders and export via string to Swift and Objective-C `UIColor`. `UIStackView` used for layout with various `UIKit` controls for input.

## General Techniques

* Timers, Implemented with `Timer` and `CADisplayLink`

* GCD Threading - `Grand Central Dispatch` example

* `URLSession` synchronous request.

## Templates

* Starting points for Playgrounds based on `UIViewController`, `UINavigationController` and `ARKit` (`SceneKit` and `SpriteKit` Views)


### Techniques Used
`UIKit` `CoreAnimation` `ARKit` `Metal`
